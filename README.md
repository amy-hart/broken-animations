# DigiDino

DigiDino is a virtual pet game created for mobile. As a responsible pet owner your goal is to keep your dinosaur fit and healthy throughout its life. 

# Gameplay
* Wait for the app to load, and then give your dinosaur a name. 
* Once you've given your pet a name hit the 'Save' button to get started.
* As time passes your dinosaur's life-levels will decrease. If those life-levels reach zero your pet will die an untimely dealth. Keep your dinosaur fit and healthy by interacting with it as often as you can.
* Unfortunately nobody can live forever, so when your pet reaches the ripe old age of '100' it will die, and the game will restart.

# Interacting with your dinosaur
