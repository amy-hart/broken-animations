# Digi Dino

Digi Dino is a virtual pet game created for mobile. As a responsible pet owner your goal is to keep your dinosaur fit and healthy throughout its lifetime. 

# Installation
These installation instructions assume that you already have Node.js, and the NPM package manager installed on your machine. You'll also need to have Expo installed on your machine, along with an Android/ iOS simulator, or the Expo application for your Android/ iOS mobile device.

1. Clone down the repo:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
git clone git@github.com:amy-hart/digi-dino.git
```
2. Install any dependencies: 
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
npm install
```
3. Move into the 'digi-dino' directory:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
cd digi-dino
```
4. Start Expo:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
expo start
```
5. Once Expo has started you can launch the application via the Android/ iOS simulator on your machine. Alternatively you can launch the Digi Dino application via the Expo application on your Android/ iOS mobile device.

# Gameplay
* Wait for the app to load.  
* Give your dinosaur a name, and hit the 'Save' button to get started.
* As time passes your dinosaur's life-levels will decrease. If those life-levels reach zero your pet will die an untimely death! Keep your pet fit and healthy by interacting with it as often as you can.
* Unfortunately nobody can live forever, when your pet reaches the ripe old age of '100' it will pass away. The game will then restart.

# Interacting with your dinosaur
* Give your dinosaur a name.
* Play with your dinosaur to increase its fitness levels.
* Feed your dinosaur to increase its fullness levels.
* Put your dinosaur to bed to increase its energy levels.
* Socialise your dinosaur to increase its social skills.
* Use the pooper scooper to increase cleanliness.

# Acknowledgments

I contributed to this project along with two other students from my coding bootcamp, Elena Stagg, and Stephen Royle. This was our first attempt at app development, and our first time experimenting with React Native. We built this application together as team to demonstrate the skills we'd learnt during our time on the course.

This project was inspired by a [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/) learning project to create a virtual pet using JavaScript.
